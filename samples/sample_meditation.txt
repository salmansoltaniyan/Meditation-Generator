Welcome.
Find a comfortable position, either seated or lying down.
Allow your body to settle.
Close your eyes gently.
\[PAUSE:5]

Take a slow, deep breath in through the nose.
Let the breath travel all the way down into the belly.
\[PAUSE:4]

Exhale slowly through the mouth, releasing any tension.
\[PAUSE:5]

Again—inhale slowly through the nose.
Feel the chest rise.
Feel the belly expand.
\[PAUSE:4]

Exhale gently, letting the body soften.
\[PAUSE:6]

Now, allow your breathing to find its natural rhythm.
Simply notice each inhale…
and each exhale.
\[PAUSE:8]

As you breathe in, feel the coolness of the air at the tip of your nose.
As you breathe out, notice the warmth leaving your body.
\[PAUSE:8]

Your breath is an anchor.
Always here.
Always steady.
\[PAUSE:8]

If thoughts arise, let them drift by—like clouds in the sky.
Gently return your attention to the breath.
Inhale…
Exhale…
\[PAUSE:10]

Feel the body supported by the ground beneath you.
No need to hold on to anything.
Just breathing.
Just being.
\[PAUSE:10]

Notice the slight pause at the top of each inhale.
A stillness…
a space.
\[PAUSE:6]

Notice the pause at the end of each exhale.
Another space.
Another moment of quiet.
\[PAUSE:8]

Breathing in—new energy enters the body.
Breathing out—release, and let go.
\[PAUSE:10]

Now, bring your attention to the rise and fall of the belly.
With each inhale, the belly expands.
With each exhale, it softens.
\[PAUSE:8]

Stay with this gentle rhythm.
Breathing in calm…
Breathing out ease.
\[PAUSE:12]

If the mind wanders, it’s okay.
Softly bring it back to the breath.
Inhale…
Exhale…
\[PAUSE:12]

Let your breath slow even more.
Inhale… count silently to four.
One… two… three… four.
\[PAUSE:4]

Exhale… count silently to six.
One… two… three… four… five… six.
\[PAUSE:6]

Continue this rhythm for a few rounds.
\[PAUSE:20]

Now, let go of the counting.
Return to simply watching the breath.
Natural.
Effortless.
\[PAUSE:12]

Feel the body at ease.
The mind calm.
The breath steady.
\[PAUSE:12]

Take a final deep breath in—filling the lungs completely.
Hold it for a moment.
\[PAUSE:4]

And exhale fully, releasing everything.
\[PAUSE:8]

When you’re ready, gently wiggle your fingers and toes.
Slowly bring awareness back to your surroundings.
\[PAUSE:6]

Take one last soft breath in…
and out.
\[PAUSE:6]

When it feels right, open your eyes.
Your meditation is complete.
\[PAUSE:4]
